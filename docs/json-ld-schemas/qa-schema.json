      "text": "The Cooper & Hunter 12000 BTU mini split operates at just 26 dB on the lowest fan setting, which is quieter than a whisper (30 dB). Many customers report sleeping comfortably with the unit running. The inverter technology eliminates the start-stop cycling noise common in traditional AC units. For maximum quiet operation, use the 'sleep mode' feature which reduces noise to the minimum level.",
