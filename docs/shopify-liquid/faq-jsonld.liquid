          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "As a general rule, you need about 20 BTU per square foot of living space. For a 250 sq ft room, a 6,000 BTU unit is sufficient. For 400-550 sq ft, choose a 12,000 BTU unit. For 550-700 sq ft, go with 18,000 BTU. Factors like ceiling height, insulation quality, sun exposure, and climate zone may require adjustments to these calculations."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "While some DIY-friendly mini split systems come with pre-charged refrigerant lines, we recommend professional installation for optimal performance and to maintain warranty coverage. Professional installation ensures proper refrigerant handling, electrical connections, and unit placement for maximum efficiency."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) measures how efficiently an air conditioner cools over an entire season. Higher SEER ratings mean lower energy bills. Mini splits with SEER ratings of 20+ are considered highly efficient. A unit with SEER 22 can save 30-50% on cooling costs compared to older systems with SEER 10-13."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes! Most modern mini split systems are heat pumps that provide both cooling in summer and heating in winter. They can efficiently heat your space down to temperatures as low as -15°F to -22°F depending on the model. This makes them an excellent year-round climate control solution."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Single-zone systems have one outdoor unit connected to one indoor unit, ideal for cooling/heating a single room or space. Multi-zone systems have one outdoor unit connected to 2-5 indoor units, allowing independent temperature control in multiple rooms. Multi-zone systems are more cost-effective than installing separate single-zone systems for multiple rooms."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "With proper maintenance, mini split systems typically last 15-20 years. Regular maintenance includes cleaning filters monthly, annual professional inspections, and keeping the outdoor unit clear of debris. Inverter-driven compressors in modern units experience less wear and tend to have longer lifespans than traditional AC systems."
